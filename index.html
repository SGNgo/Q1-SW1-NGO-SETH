	<p style="color:#E07D00;"> My name is <strong>Seth Ngo</strong> and I have been playing <em>Basketball</em> since I was a kid. I grew up with the game and began to love it more as the years went by. It is a well-known sport in all countries. 
		<br/>I enjoy watching, studying, and playing Basketball. I grew up with most NBA players that played in the <mark>2010-2020</mark> era. I was inspired to be like them when I grow up. My dad intoduced me to the sport at a young age, he is also a player, good but <strong>not professional</strong>. From then on I was inspired and I wanted to become a Basketball player.</p>
